- [ ] Implement chunking strategy for existing knowledge base
- [ ] Convert current internet_down.md to structured document format
- [ ] Create document processor for multiple formats

### Week 3: Embedding Layer
- [ ] Implement multilingual embedding using sentence-transformers
- [ ] Set up vector store (Chroma for development)
- [ ] Create indexing pipeline for documents
- [ ] Benchmark embedding performance with Malayalam text

### Week 4: Basic Retrieval
- [ ] Implement semantic search functionality
- [ ] Add keyword-based fallback search
- [ ] Create simple hybrid retrieval mechanism
- [ ] Develop API for querying the retrieval system

## Phase 2: Enhancement (Weeks 5-8)

### Week 5: Context Awareness
- [ ] Implement conversation history tracking
- [ ] Develop context integration for queries
- [ ] Create session management for persistent context
- [ ] Test with multi-turn troubleshooting scenarios

### Week 6: Advanced Retrieval
- [ ] Implement metadata filtering
- [ ] Develop weighted scoring algorithm
- [ ] Add re-ranking strategies
- [ ] Create result diversity mechanism

### Week 7: Response Generation
- [ ] Develop template-based response generation
- [ ] Implement language adaptation (Malayalam/English)
- [ ] Create progressive disclosure mechanism
- [ ] Add support for multi-modal responses

### Week 8: Feedback System
- [ ] Implement resolution tracking
- [ ] Create feedback collection mechanism
- [ ] Develop knowledge gap detection
- [ ] Set up analytics for retrieval performance

## Phase 3: Intelligence (Weeks 9-12)

### Week 9: Personalization
- [ ] Implement customer profile integration
- [ ] Develop technical level adaptation
- [ ] Create personalized response generation
- [ ] Test with various customer profiles

### Week 10: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize vector search with HNSW
- [ ] Add batch processing for queries
- [ ] Benchmark and optimize response times

### Week 11: Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] Set up Prometheus for system monitoring
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboards for key metrics
- [ ] Implement logging for retrieval accuracy
- [ ] Develop usage pattern analytics

### Week 12: Integration and Deployment
- [ ] Integrate with existing call_flow.py
- [ ] Create migration path from old RAG to new system
- [ ] Develop A/B testing mechanism
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment

## Resources Required

### Development Team
- 1 ML Engineer (embeddings, retrieval)
- 1 Backend Developer (API, integration)
- 1 Knowledge Engineer (document processing)
- 1 Malayalam Language Expert (testing, evaluation)

### Infrastructure
- Development environment with GPU support
- Vector database storage
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Test environment for call flow integration

### External Dependencies
- Sentence Transformers library
- Vector database (FAISS/Chroma/Pinecone)
- Malayalam language resources
- Telecom domain knowledge base

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Query response time < 200ms
- Retrieval accuracy > 85% (relevant results in top 3)
- System uptime > 99.9%
- Memory usage < 4GB

### Business Metrics
- First-call resolution rate improvement > 15%
- Average call duration reduction > 20%
- Customer satisfaction score improvement > 10%
- Agent escalation reduction > 25%

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. Malayalam language model performance limitations
2. Integration challenges with existing system
3. Performance issues with large knowledge base
4. User adoption of new system

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Fallback to keyword search when semantic search fails
2. Phased integration with A/B testing
3. Implement efficient indexing and caching strategies
4. Provide comprehensive training and documentation
